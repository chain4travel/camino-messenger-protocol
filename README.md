> üöß **EARLY DAYS NOTICE** üöß:
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Although we released our first productive Message Types version, it is still early days and partners make substantial and frequent contributions to the Camino Message Types. Please be aware that the Camino Messenger Protocol is still undergoing active development. The code, guidelines, and instructions may be subject to change.

The Camino Messenger protocol is created together with Partners from each vertical (flights, hotels, holiday homes, transfers, car rental, cruise,..). The objective is to create a message standard for the Camino Messenger, that is considered simple, efficient, complete, robust and easy to integrate by all partners. And conclusively it will delightfully be implemented and used by partners. As all other Camino Network components, the Camino Messenger Protocol is open source. Free to be used anywhere, but of course targeted to be used with the Camino Messenger.
