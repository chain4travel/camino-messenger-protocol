// ## Accommodation Services
//
// The Accommodation services are used for both hotels and holiday homes, often called short term rentals.
//
// Any search message response in the Camino Messenger Protocol only includes dynamic data. Static data can
// be cached and kept up to data with the Product List and Product Details messages.
//
// This package is a **WIP**.

// ### Accommodation Search Request Message Type
//
// The `Accommodation Search Request` message type facilitates the request for accommodations like hotel and holiday
// home searches within the platform. In the request the market, language and currency are specified at the top-level.
// In the Unit we specify the details of the trip like dates, properties or locations or filters.
// The purpose of such a structure is to allow for multi-room and multi-property searches, so that several rooms or houses
// can be requested for the same dates and location or for the purpose of a tour or roadtrip, several accommodations for
// sequential dates and different locations.
//
// Developers leveraging this message type should ensure proper validation and handling, especially considering fields
// that are still under review, like `speech_request`.

// ### Accommodation Search Response
//
// The `Accommodation Search Response` message type facilitates the response for accommodations like hotel and holiday
// home searches within the platform. In the response a search_id must be included and a search_option_id for every bookable
// option responded. Included, compulsary and optional services can be included. A simple "free cancellation upto" can
// be set or full cancellation pilicies can be included.
