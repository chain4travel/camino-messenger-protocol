// Breakdown is a recursively inherited object of PriceDetail. This way complex

// ### Simple Price type message Price
//
// Value of the price, this should be an integer converted to string.
//
// This field is a string intentionally. Because the currency can be a crypto
// currency, we need a reliable way to represent big integers as most of the crypto
// currencies have 18 decimals precision.
//
// Definition of the price message: The combination of "value" and "decimals" fields
// express always the value of the currency, not of the fraction of the currency [
// ETH not wei, CAM and not aCAM, BTC and not Satoshi, EUR not EUR-Cents ] Be aware
// that partners should not do rounding with crypto currencies.
//
// Example implementations: off-chain payment of 100 € or 100 $: value=10000
// decimals=2 iso_currency=EUR or USD
//
// On-chain payment of 100.65 EURSH value=10065 decimals=2 contract_address=0x...
//  this currency has 5 decimals on Columbus and conclusively to create the
//  transaction value, 10065 must be divided by 10^2 = 100.65 EURSH and created in
//  its smallest fraction by multiplying  100.65 EURSH * 10^5 => 10065000 (example
//  conversion to bigint without losing accuracy: bigint(10065) * 10^(5-2))
//
// On-chain payment of 0.0065 BTC value=65 decimals=4 contract_address=0x... Using
//  the contract address, we get the decimals decimals and the currency name or
//  abbreviation: 8 decimals & WBTC Because we see 4 decimals specified in the
//  message we divide 65 by 10^4 == 0.0065 WBTC (for showing in the front-end UIs)
//
//  This currency has 8 decimals on-chain and conclusively to use the value of
//  0.0065 for on-chain operations must be converted to big integer as bigint(65) *
//  10^(8-4) == 650000
//
// On-chain payment of 1 nCAM value=1 decimals=9 this currency has denominator 18 on
//  Columbus and conclusively to mint the value of 1 nCam must be divided by 10^9 =
//  0.000000001 CAM and minted in its smallest fraction by multiplying 0.000000001 *
//  10^18 => 1000000000 aCAM
