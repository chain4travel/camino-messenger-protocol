  // In most cases like in accommodation, just the field "code" and "type" will be
  // used. For example in case of a GiataID (for example code=182568), a provider
  // hotel code (for example a hotel code=AESPMI1234), a transfer code, etc.
  // However, for flight and train it is common to have a code and a number like "EW
  // 51" or "ICE 2803", which would then be code=EW and number=51 or code=ICE and
  // number=2803. It is not recommended to concatenate for example the airline code
  // and the flight number into the code field as "EW 51", as this would cause different
  // implementations for providers of the same product.
  //
  // Please note that when utilizing licensed codes or formats such as GiataID and DRV
  // GlobalTypes, it is the partners' responsibility to confirm and settle any associated
  // license fees directly with the respective organizations

  // the hotel with a ski pass or the hotel with a rent a car. For packages we can imagine
  // an accommodation, the accommodation with a flight and transfer or the accommodation with
  // a flight and a rent a car. As the product descriptions from the supplier will have
