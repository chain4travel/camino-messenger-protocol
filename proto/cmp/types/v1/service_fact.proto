// Service fact message type
// Service facts are smaller services that are included, can be booked optionally
// or must be booked together with a main product or service. For example on Christmas
// eve a gala dinner is included in the stay. Or an early check-in can be booked when
// travellers have an early flight. Or cleaning cost must be included for every booking
// of a holiday home.
//
// It is important that these optional, included or compulsary services are simple. For
// complex combinations like a hotel with a rent-a-car or a skipass or ski lessons, packages
// should be used so that each service can be described properly and a choice of what car,
// which ski pass and what level of ski class that be properly selected.
