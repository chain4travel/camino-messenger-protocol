## This file will do a diff against the provided branch (defaults to c4t) for added files
## As the definition of the versioning is to always create a new version if a file has been changed
## we make sure that every structure change is a breaking change. 
##
## But at the same time it's hard to see the actual changes in the new version as there is no 
## history of changes. Therefore this script exists which will:
##
## * Get the *added* files out of the git history
## * Extract the version 
## * Check if a file with version-1 exists in the origin branch
## * Do a diff against the other file
##
## * Get the *modified* files 
## * Check if there are any structural changes
## * Throw an error in case a structural change is detected
